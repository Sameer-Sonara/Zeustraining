Day 1: Web Development Basics
HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard language used to create and design webpages.
It uses tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and forms.

Inline vs Block Elements
Inline Elements:
Take only as much width as needed.
Examples:  bold, italic

Block Elements:
Take the full available width.
Examples: headings, paragraphs

Ways to Implement CSS

Inline – CSS is added directly to HTML tags using the style attribute.
Internal – CSS is written inside <style> tags in the <head> section of the HTML file.
External – CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked using the <link> tag.

Preferred method: External CSS – It separates style from content, improves reusability, maintainability, and readability.


CSS Selectors
Element Selector – Selects all elements of a specific type.
Example: p { color: red; }

Class Selector – Selects all elements with a given class.
Example: .box { padding: 10px; }

ID Selector – Selects a single unique element.
Example: #header { background: black; }

Ways to Add JavaScript

Inline – JS is added directly within HTML tags using events like onclick.
Internal – JS code is written inside <script> tags in the HTML file.
External – JS code is written in a separate .js file and linked using <script src="script.js"></script>.

Preferred method: External JS – It keeps code modular, reusable, cleaner, and more readable.
